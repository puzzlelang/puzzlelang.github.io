# Programming beyond code

***"Programing isn't always just done with code."***

Of course, code is the most common way to program software. But there are other ways to develop software beyond code.

> Code is a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do, remember? These "instructions", however can also be described in other ways as well - beyond code.


Code is also the lowest level to describe there instructions. But over time, people have found ways to make software development possible not just by writing code, but by providing more abstract ways to program - beyond code. Common examples range from "No Code" to "Low Code".

* ***No Code*** doesn't require writing any code. Typically programming is done by using WYSIWYG Tools
* ***Low Code*** does require writing code, but not necesseraly. This is typically a mix of code and WYSIWYG tools.
